//Add a static function uploadImage that takes an image and completion closure with an identifier String parameter
//note: We use an identifier for the image instead of a URL because we are uploading to Firebase. If we were uploading to Amazon S3 or other cloud service, we would probably return a URL instead of identifier.
//Implement a mock response by calling the completion closure with -K1l4125TYvKMc7rcp5e as the identifier
//Add a static function imageForIdentifier that takes an identifier and completion closure with an optional UIImage parameter
//Implement a mock response by returning a UIImage named "MockPhoto"
//Add a sample photo to the Assets.xcassets folder named MockPhoto for you to use as staged data.
